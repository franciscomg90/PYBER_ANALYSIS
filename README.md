# PYBER_ANALYSIS
Using Matplotlib &amp; Pandas 

## Overview
The object of this challenge is to set a new data frame from the ride-fares data provided and create a line chart using pandas and matplotlib to easily interpret the data results and analyze the fares by city type behavior.

## Results
>**Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.**
Obtaining the total rides by city type we found that Urban has the biggest rides quiantity.
